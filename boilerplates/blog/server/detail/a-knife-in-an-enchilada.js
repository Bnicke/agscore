		"detail": "<p>2014 was a big year for people forgetting about guns in their luggage.</p> <p>In fact, according to information on contraband that the TSA just released in its year in review, the number of firearms confiscated by the TSA hit a record high of 2,212 — a 22% increase from 2013 to 2014.</p> <p>Unloaded guns are allowed in checked luggage for licensed owners, but not okay to pack in carry on bags. Travelers caught with the illegal firearms typically claimed to have forgotten they were carrying a deadly weapon.</p> <p>Some people got a little more creative with the weapons they were trying to sneak on board — one woman was caught with an 8.5-inch knife in her enchilada. The enchilada, sadly, was most likely never consumed.</p> <p>Other items people used to try and conceal knives and razor blades: pens, a phone case, lipstick, neck pillows, a bag of potato chips, a tube of toothpaste and a Scooby Doo greeting card.</p><img class=\"scaled-image\" width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/american-football-63109_640.jpg\" /><p>Travelers also attempted to carry explosives on board — hundreds of fireworks and hand grenades were confiscated. One passenger attempted to get an unloaded cannon barrel on board.</p> <p>Marijuana, cocaine, and heroin were the most frequently confiscated drugs.</p> <p>The TSA also seized more than $10 million worth of counterfeit goods like sports jerseys and faux Beats by Dre headphones.</p> <p>Despite the terrifying things people continue to try to take on planes, the TSA claims to be improving the efficiency of their security screenings — wait times at security checks were allegedly down to under 20 minutes for 96.6% of travelers.</p>",
